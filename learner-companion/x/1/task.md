# Introduction 
Welcome to the recap Workshop for Calesi and Plugins!
To run and test the application, go into incidents app via `cd ../incidents-app && cds watch`.
You can run both the application and the learner companion, if you keep two console windows open and running!

# Task

Check out the initial version of the incidents app. Select an incident from the incident list and look at the conversation. Notice, that there are no attachments possible on the incidents. Have a look at the format of the logs in the console.

Next, we want to add change tracking to the application. Have a look at how to add it on the readme file of its repository:
